# YouTube Uploader Automation

This project automates uploading videos to YouTube (Shorts & Landscape) using the YouTube Data API v3.  
It organizes videos into playlists, sets privacy, and moves uploaded files into an `uploaded/` folder.

## üîë First-Time Authentication

## ‚öôÔ∏è Playlists Configuration

To automatically add uploaded videos to the right playlist, update the `config.py` file in the project root:

```json
{
  "playlists": {
    "shorts": "YOUR_SHORTS_PLAYLIST_ID",
    "landscape": "YOUR_LANDSCAPE_PLAYLIST_ID"
  }
}
```

üëâ Replace `YOUR_SHORTS_PLAYLIST_ID` and `YOUR_LANDSCAPE_PLAYLIST_ID` with your actual YouTube playlist IDs.  
You can find the playlist ID in the YouTube playlist URL:  

```
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Place your videos under:

```
videos/shorts/
videos/landscape/
```

2. Run the uploader script:

```bash
python upload_folder.py
```

3. The script will:
   - Summarize how many Shorts & Landscape videos are found  
   - Ask for confirmation before starting upload  
   - Upload videos as **Unlisted** and **Not Made for Kids**  
   - Add them to the correct playlist  
   - Move uploaded files to `videos/uploaded/`
